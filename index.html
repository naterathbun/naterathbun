      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I'm Nathan Rathbun, a Software Engineering Manager with a background in development, international business and project management. I'm an articulate communicator with extensive experience building diverse and distributed teams. I'm also a certified Scrum Master, a speaker of Japanese and an unflappable optimist.</p>
      <p>My journey in the tech industry has spanned various sectors, including automotive and online ordering, where I honed my leadership abilities and consistently delivered great results. I've written payment processor and delivery integrations, managed multiple distributed development teams and run Scrum ceremonies as well. I bring a contagious positive energy to every group I join and pride myself on putting my team first, supporting them in every way I can as a servant leader. </p>
      <p>Beyond my technical and managerial skills, I'm deeply committed to fostering inclusion, creativity, and building a culture of results. I've worked in diverse settings, from large enterprises to nimble startups, collaborating with teams spanning the globe. I've learned time and time again that when you bring together interesting problems and motivated, talented people, cool things happen. </p>
      <h2>As an Engineering Manager</h2>
      <p>My focus is on mentoring, coaching, and nurturing the career growth of my team members. I have a strong belief in connecting individuals with the purpose of their work, recognizing that exceptional results come from shared passion and a common vision. I excel at identifying and eliminating obstacles to performance and clearing the way so my team can do what they do best.</p>
      <h2>As a Scrum Master</h2>
      <p>Prior to my roles in Engineering Management, I spent two years as a Scrum Master. In that time, I led the scrum processes of three development teams and promoted Scrum adoption and Agile Methodologies across my company. I ran scrum ceremonies while continuously evaluating and refining processes the dev teams depended on. I made it my mission to find and eliminate barriers to the teams' success, and to be the person they came to when things became blocked, got confusing or started heading south.</p>
      <h2>As a Developer</h2>
      <p>Before pivoting my career towards management, for three years I wrote code in .net, Javascript, MSSQL, MongoDB and worked heavily in Microsoft Azure. I implemented complete API integrations for multiple payment processors and Point of Sale (POS) systems, Doordash and other delivery interfaces. I made it my goal to write clean code and build full coverage unit tests. I also took on additional responsibilities providing client support for our production sites. While my current emphasis is on team development, my technical skills remain sharp, enabling me to provide valuable insights and make well-informed development decisions.</p>
