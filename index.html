      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I'm Nathan Rathbun, a Software Engineering Manager with a background in development, international business and project management. I'm an articulate communicator with extensive experience building diverse and distributed teams. I'm also a certified Scrum Master, a speaker of Japanese and an unflappable optimist.</p>
      <p>I've worked in multiple industries, for both large enterprise and small startups, with a plethora of different teams and technologies. I've learned again and again that when you bring together interesting problems and motivated, talented people, cool things happen. </p>
      <p>I have a drive to know exactly what makes things tick, and people doubly so. For me, it's all about the team: strong relationships, direct communication and figuring out how to solve challenges - together. I take pride in my interpersonal skills every bit as much as my technical ones and know that both go hand-in-hand when building great teams and great software.</p>
      <h2>As an Engineering Manager</h2>
      <p>I lead multiple teams of front and backend software developers, including mentoring, hiring, coaching and career development. I ensure team members are always connected to the outcomes and purpose of their work. I support them by identifying and eliminating obstacles to their success, performance and growth. Every day, I collaborate with other leaders and teams across departments to drive program success. As an Engineering Manager, I draw from my experiences in both automotive manufacturing and software development to continuously improve processes and workflows for my team, making sure they always have the tools they need to succeed.
      <h2>As a Scrum Master</h2>
      <p>Prior to my roles in Engineering Management, I spent two years as a Scrum Master. In that time, I led the scrum processes of three development teams and promoted Scrum adoption and Agile Methodologies across my company. I ran scrum ceremonies while continuously evaluating and refining processes the dev teams depended on. I made it my mission to find and eliminate barriers to the teams' success, and to be the person they came to when things became blocked, got confusing or started heading south.</p>
      <h2>As a Developer</h2>
      <p>Before pivoting my career towards management, for three years I wrote code in .net, Javascript, MSSQL, MongoDB and worked heavily in Microsoft Azure. I implemented complete API integrations for multiple payment processors and Point of Sale (POS) systems, Doordash and other delivery interfaces. I strived to write clean code and build full coverage unit tests using MSTest and Moq frameworks. I also took on additional responsibilities providing client support for our production sites. Though I have transitioned my focus from writing code to growing teams, my technical skills remain sharp, and I stay closely involved in development. This expertise enables me to make informed decisions and provide valuable insights to my teams, ultimately leading to better outcomes.</p>
